# ABTest

A reference guide to A/B testing where I look at common one and two sample significance tests for categorical and continuous data.

For continuous data, I explore whether a pop bands' heights differ significantly from the population's mean.

For categorical data, I look at how to detect in Wikipedia's banner ads whether targeting users by country increases their likelihood of donating.
